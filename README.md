Harnek Singh Dadiala
I have a Bachelor degree in Coumputer Science. I worked in different roles starting as developer and then to Team lead. 
1998 I started as contract Developer in APS and ended my engagement at APS in 2002 as Team Lead.
2003 started my own company that provided software development services to a broad range of clients.
I got me Real Estate license in 2004 and worked part time as a realtor.
In 2010 shut down my software development company and switched to real estate full time and I am active as an Associate Broker currently.
My goal is marry both software development and Real Estate expirence and get to be part of technology revolution that is coming in the FINTECH sphere.
FINTECH is going to be a big part of changes in how real estate (one of the domains) is going to be impacted in a very big way and I want to be part of it.
